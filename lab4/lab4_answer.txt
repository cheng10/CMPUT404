Question 1:
After starting a brand new django application and running the runserver command, what does the browser show you?

A webpage shows "It works!"

Question 2:
After creating the first view within polls, what does the browser show you when navigating to / and to /polls respectively?

For /, it is 404 page not found. For for /polls, it is a line of "Hello World. You're at the polls index."

Question 3:
What is a Django migration and why do we need them?

Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into the database schema.

Question 4:
What do you see after you log into the Django Administration site? From a high level, how do you get custom models to appear in the Django admin?

I can see a user administration page where I can add/delete user/group. I can also add questions and answers for the poll.
I can get custom models from editing polls/admin.py.

Question 5:
What do you see when you go to /polls/38/ in your browser? What about /polls/38/results and /polls/38/vote? What happens when you don’t put a number, and instead use a string? How would you modify the urls.py file to allow arbitrary alphabetic characters?

/polls/38 shows "You're looing at question 38." /polls/38/results gives the "You're looking at the result of the question 38." /polls/38/vote shows similar line. When a put a string, it shows 404 page not found. Edit the regular to match the arbitrary alphabetic characters will do the jogb.

Why is it a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates?

The hardcode url is very hard to change.However, a templates can be used by many webpages which have a bunch of different urls.

Question 7:
What are the benefits of using Django’s generic views over writing views ‘the hard way’? When should you use a generic view and when shouldn’t you use a generic view?

Question 8:
Why is it a good idea to write unit tests for our code?
